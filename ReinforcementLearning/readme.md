It is possible that your selected environment will not support one of three.  If that is the case provide a clear rationale that notes your attempt and the outcome.

4. Provide a random, Q, and DQ learning approach to address reaching the goal.

4. Do all the main work in python scripts with an associated notebook that provides documentation and a software tour of your scripts.  The documentation contains the goal, reward structure, and description (and rationale) of the key hyperparmaters used for each appoach.  The software tour provides calls and results for each key area in the code and contains the associated results in the notebook.  The last section of the notebook provides a summary of your results noting rationale for each approach's results and recommendations to further improve.
