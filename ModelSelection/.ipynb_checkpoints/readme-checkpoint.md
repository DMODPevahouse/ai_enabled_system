# Model Selection in 2 Parts

* ***Part 1***: Explore the data set on speed dating and construct two models that provide some valued insight such as grouping or predictions. The models must come from different model areas such as listed as categories in the ModelTypes document. You must justify your answer considering the data and the prediction value.  
* ***Part 2***: Explore a car data set and follow the suggestions in the python to build a model that predicts the amount of time that a car stays on the lot unsold.  This requires populating a python script and building a working docker image.


For the speed dating section, I took a look at the data and manually evaluated it, selecting some features that I predict would be useful. Then based on those features I selected a model that would perform well with those. I did not get into any code evaluation of the models, but more so speculations and predictions based on knowledge provided of the scenario and what seems to be related. CarFactors has its own readme.
