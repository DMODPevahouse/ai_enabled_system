    "### Summary\n",
    "This assignment was intended to set up a model that would take in the cars.csv and give a small microservice that would allow people to insert information about their vehicle that is common for determining problems, such as odometer, year it was made, bodytype, price, transmission type, and using that data to predict the duration until a part failure would happen. This models performance is subpar and could definitely be improved. The end goal of having a service respond based on the port did infact accomplish the goal of making a prediction, though it may not be incredibly accurate.\n",
    "### Model improvements\n",
    "Things that could have been done to improve the model was investigate other means of normalization/scaling, weight the features based on what seems to have the most impact, tune the model itself with parameters that would be more beneficial to this given case. Correlation and testing other features would have been good as well. More data could have helped as well to include, but it is possible that the data could have been overfitted as well, though it did not appear to be the case. If there was more time, testing knn and other models may have made a bigger impact as well.  "
